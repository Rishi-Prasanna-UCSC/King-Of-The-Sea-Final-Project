You are a great white shark who rules all of the seven seas, and keeps the food chain balanced!
But one day…
OH NO! An evil magical sea king set on destroying your rule uses a magic spell to transform you into a tiny plant-eating herring fish! Oh, no! Now you’re at the bottom of the food chain!
Your goal is to progress through each and every single level (we’re making this game a Nitrome-like level system), and eventually transform back into a great white shark by the end of the game’s narrative!
Throughout the game, you gain the abilities to transform (using magic) into different creatures, such as a mackerel (an omnivorous fish that can feed on bigger prey), an octopus (which can hold multiple objects at once), a hammerhead shark (which can barge through rock walls), and eventually the great white shark.
This game has kind of a “trail” aspect to it, such that the character becomes a bigger and bigger fish and learns more about the ocean kingdom.
